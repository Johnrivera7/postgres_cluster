# PostgreSQL Cluster with Patroni and Consul
Automated script for deploying a PostgreSQL cluster using Consul as the distributed system coordinator and Patroni for high availability.

## Repository Overview
This script automates the deployment of a PostgreSQL cluster with Consul handling service discovery and configuration, and Patroni ensuring high availability. The cluster setup includes multiple PostgreSQL nodes where Consul manages the state of the cluster and Patroni provides seamless failover.

## Prerequisites
- Ubuntu servers for each PostgreSQL node.
- Open ports for Consul (8300, 8301, 8302, 8500, 8600), Patroni/PostgreSQL (5432, 8008), and SSH (22).
- Instances should have a valid hostname.
